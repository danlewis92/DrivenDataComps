# DrivenDataComps
Attempts at DrivenData.org Competitions.

1) Attempt at the Conser-vision Practice Area: Image Classification challenge, adapted from their provided Example notebook (run as a kaggle notebook). I deliberately keep EDA to a minimum, in order to quickly build a model for submission and iterate from there. I scored 31 in the world using this approach.
